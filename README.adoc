== Introduction

In a customer project I came across _Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture_ <<gyhd>>, and since
value objects https://github.com/melsicon/value-comparison[seem to be] my thing and I had seen Dan
Bergh Johnsson excellent presentation <<pov>>, of course my interest was piqued.

To get that out of the way first: This is not a review of the book, just a few notes on some of the
code from chapter 4 _Implementing a Use Case_.

toc::[]

== Motivation

In the subchapter _Validating Input_ <<gyhd>> uses a `SelfValidating` class, implemented like this:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public abstract class SelfValidating<T> {
  private Validator validator;

  public SelfValidating() {
    ValidatorFactory factory = Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory();
    validator = factory.getValidator();
  }

  protected void validateSelf() {
    Set<ConstraintViolation<T>> violations = validator.validate((T) this);
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new ConstraintViolationException(violations);
    }
  }
}
----

The first thing you probably see is the interesting use of generics, only to make an unnecessary
unchecked cast. Due to type erasure everything is gone during runtime, but the purpose is unclear.

The second thing is the creation of a Jakarta Bean Validation <<jbv>> `ValidatorFactory` for _every_
object. The
https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/#validationapi-bootstrapping-validatorfactory[documentation]
recommends to "`__cache ValidatorFactory objects and reuse them for optimal performances__ [sic]`"
and remarks that building a `ValidatorFactory` can be
https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/#validationapi-bootstrapping-examples[expensive].

So, let's benchmark this, shall we?

== Structure

We implement `SelfValidating` like presented in the book in package
`link:{srcdir}/self_validating[self_validating]`.

Then we try to fix some problems in `link:{srcdir}/validated[validated]`, see
xref:_discussion[Discussion].

An alternative is implemented in `link:{srcdir}/immutables[immutables]`.

For benchmark purposes we also use a `link:{srcdir}/pojo[pojo]` and reimplement `self_validating`
and `validated` with
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/bean-validation/3.0/[Jakarta Bean Validation 3.0] in
`link:{srcdir}/jee9[jee9]`.

[#_discussion]
== Discussion

In _Validating Input_ <<gyhd>> we read "`__In the Java world, the de facto standard for [validation
checks] is the Bean Validation API.__`" Well, for Java Beans maybe. There are good alternatives,
like Guava's https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/PreconditionsExplained[Preconditions]. And
interdependencies are *much* easier to express.

Nullability in Java is a much-discussed issue, and is in most cases best handled via static
analysis. There are tools like the
https://checkerframework.org/manual/#nullness-checker[Checker Framework] and
https://github.com/uber/NullAway[NullAway], IntelliJ IDEA supports
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/nullable-and-notnull-annotations.html[real time checks], even
the Spring Framework
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#null-safety[provides
annotations].

None of them is supported by Jakarta Bean Validation, of course. Also, tools like
https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/userguide/index.md[AutoValue] and
http://immutables.github.io[Immutables] provide null-safety by default.

Therefore, we don't use `@NotNull` for benchmarking, since it would be an unfair comparison.

In this example we model a person to have a given name with at least on character (might be blank)
and an optional surname with at least one character when present. In practice it is debatable how
this would improve your business logic and whether just null-safety and input validation at the
external API would be better. To https://twitter.com/odrotbohm/status/1055031632917340160[quote]
Oliver Drotbohm: "`__I think [Bean Validation is] absolutely awesome for input validation. In a
*domain model* you don't deal with validation. You implement business constraints. That's a
different story and I often see projects where it's been applied blindly because it looks
convenient.__`"

But we are here to benchmark validation, not write business logic, so this should suffice.

=== Improving the Code

If we look at the https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/#validationapi-bootstrapping-examples[example]
we see that we should cache the `ValidatorFactory` somewhere and close it at application shutdown.
Usually, a framework does this for us, and we acquire a `Validator` via dependency injection.

We might be tempted to semi-fix the issue by creating some kind of global static variable,
initialized at application start up, but there are additional problems with inheritance.

When we define a non-final, self-validated class and inherit a self-validated class from it, we are
effectively prevented to instantiate the subclass, since the superclass calls `validateSelf()`
on a _partially constructed_ object, demonstrated in
`link:{testdir}/self_validating/inheritance/MovieTicketTest.java[a unit test]`. While this is by all
means bad programming style and our tools warn us about it, it is nothing I haven't seen in
practice and is generally very error prone.

Also, we are forced to write a constructor with a lot of boilerplate, just to call one simple
function, which could easily be forgotten.

So, let's move the validation into a factory and make sure that no one else could instantiate our
object.

There is an additional problem: Hibernate (the Jakarta Bean Validation we are using)
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/6.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#_field_level_constraints[documentation]
requires that "`__When validating byte code enhanced objects, property level constraints should be
used, ...__`"

Since Project Lombok is clearly _byte code enhancing_, we need to annotate the _properties_. Which
forces us to use JavaBeans-style naming conventions and the
https://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/onX[experimental] `onMethod_=` option (the
underscore is important).

We end up with
[source,java,linenums]
----
@Value
@AllArgsConstructor(access = PACKAGE)
@Accessors(fluent = false)
public class Person {
  @Getter(onMethod_ = @NotEmpty)
  String givenName;

  @Nullable String surname;

  public Optional<@Size(min = 1) String> getSurname() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(surname);
  }
}
----
which is somewhat ugly, but at least mostly correct.

=== Alternatives

In _The Power of Constructors_ <<gyhd>> we read "`__good IDEs help with parameter name hints__`".

Yes, if you never did a side-by-side diff or read code outside *your* IDE.

We follow _Effective Java_ <<ej>> "`__Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructor
parameters__`". Here we have only two, but we already see the improvements when confronted with an
optional surname.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Value.Immutable
public abstract class Person {
  /* package */ Person() {}

  public static ImmutablePerson.Builder builder() {
    return ImmutablePerson.builder();
  }

  public abstract String givenName();

  public abstract Optional<String> surname();

  @Value.Check
  /* package */ void check() {
    checkState(!givenName().isEmpty(), "Given name must not be empty");
    checkState(!(surname().isPresent() && surname().get().isEmpty()), "Surname must not be empty");
  }
}
----
The code is a little longer, but pretty readable, correct and we don't need to write a factory.

Also, when API changes are a problem ("`__So, why not let the compiler guide us?__`" <<gyhd>>) we
could use a http://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#staged-builder[staged builder].

== Benchmarking

=== Prerequisites

You need https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk[Bazelisk] installed, with https://brew.sh[HomeBrew]
just use [source,shell]`brew install bazelbuild/tap/bazelisk`.
See also https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.0.0/install-bazelisk.html[Installing Bazel using
Bazelisk].

=== Running

Run the benchmark with

[source,shell]
----
bazel run //:benchmark
----

or

[source,shell]
----
bazel run //:jee9-benchmark
----

for the Jakarta Bean Validation 3.0 variant.

=== Tests

To run all tests, use

[source,shell]
----
bazel test //...
----

== Results

JMH Java microbenchmarks are hard to do correctly, and I don't assert that I'm an expert in that
craft. Nevertheless, these numbers give us an idea of the performance characteristics.

|===

Interestingly enough Immutables are faster than the POJO implementation, but both are more than a
factor of 100 faster than Jakarta Bean Validation and more than 250.000 faster that the approach of
_Validating Input_ <<gyhd>>.

While 0.5 μs/message overhead in your application might be acceptable, 1.3 ms will be noticeable
under load.
